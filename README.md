# Project Title: Front End Bad Bank Application

## Description of Project: 
Course 2 (front end development with React) final project in my MIT XPro Bootcamp. The course provided me with wireframes, a user story and starter code. I then refactored, expanded and deployed it.

You can see my video walk-through of the deployed app here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6eGy3GF_d0

(Please note that the app is not currently deployed.)
